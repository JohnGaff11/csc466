> ## COVID-19 Statement
> Part of West Chester University’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was to 
> switch the vast majority of instruction to remote.  This decision was made 
> out of an abundance of caution to protect the health of all members of the WCU 
> community.  Faculty have been asked to make every effort to adapt their courses 
> to this novel situation while still meeting the critical learning outcomes of 
> the course.  Students are asked to discuss any problems with the new course 
> format and schedule directly with their instructors.  Patience and flexibility 
> on everyone’s behalf are critical to our community’s navigation of this public 
> health crisis.

> ## Policy
>
> ### University Sanctioned Events Policy:
> Students participating in participating in University sanctioned events such
> as, but not limited to, the Marching Band, musical ensembles, theatre group,
> athletic events, forensics competition, etc., will be granted an excused
> absence for class periods missed. Students will be granted the privilege of
> taking, at an alternative time to be determined by the professor, scheduled
> examinations or quizzes that will be missed. I will designate such times prior
> to the event and reserve the right to provide a fair alternative to taking the
> examination or quiz that will be missed. Students must submit original
> documentation on University letterhead signed by the activity director, coach,
> or adviser detailing the specifics of the event in advance. Specific
> requirements include:
>
> 1. Responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student.
> 2. Students are expected to notify their professors as soon as they know they
> will be missing class due to a University sanctioned event.
> 3. Students are expected to complete the work requirement for each class and
> turn in assignments due on days of the event prior to their due dates unless
> other arrangements are made with myself.
> 4. If a scheduled event is postponed or canceled, the student is expected to
> go to class.
> 5. Students are not excused from classes for practice on nonevent days.
>
> The following are specifics for the student athlete:
> 1. The student athlete is expected, where possible, to schedule classes on
> days and at hours that do not conflict with athletic schedules.
> 2. Athletes are not excused from classes for practice or training-room
> treatment on nongame days.
>
> ### Email Policy:
> It is expected that faculty, staff, and students activate and maintain regular
> access to University provided e-mail accounts. Official university
> communications, including those from your instructor, will be sent through your
> university e-mail account. You are responsible for accessing that mail to be
> sure to obtain official University communications. Failure to access will not
> exempt individuals from the responsibilities associated with this course.
>
> Please abide by the following email etiquette policies to ensure clear
> communication:
> - **Subject Line**:	Please include a descriptive and specific subject heading for
> all of your emails, including course and section number (e.g. “CSC 050-23:
> Question about lab 1”).
> - **Greeting**:	Please make a clear and appropriate greeting; I will not answer
> emails addressed to “hey” or “yo”. Please address me as Dr. Ngo, or “Professor”.
> - **Tone & Style**:	Always use a tone and language that is appropriate to an
> academic setting; I will not respond to emails that are written in short-hand
> or without proper punctuation and grammar. Your emails should not resemble a
> text message.
> - **Sign and Proofread**:	Always sign your full name, especially if you are
> writing from your smart phone. Always proofread your emails before sending.
> - **Email Account**:	I do not care which email account you send email from, as
> long as it is clearly addressed and signed so that I know who you are. But
> please be advised to appropriately link the email that you wish to use with

>
> ### Computer Science Department Dishonesty Policy:
> The Computer Science Committee has adopted the following policies in regard
> to academic dishonesty in Computer Science classes:
> 1. A student found to be academically dishonest in an assignment will receive
> zero for that assignment if it is his/her first offense in that class [the
> course, not the class period], but an F for the course if it is for his/her
> second offense in that class [the course].  
> 2. A student found to be academically dishonest in a test will receive the
> grade of F in that class [the course].
> 3. For the purposes of this document on academic dishonesty, every form or
> method of evaluation in a class will be considered as being of one of two
> types: an assignment or a test. Assignments include homework assignments, and
> short quizzes [and labs]. Tests include final exams and major exams. An
> instructor has, subject to these guidelines, the discretion to determine the
> type of any other form of evaluation, such as a project, in his/her class.
> 4. A student who has received the grade of F in a course because of academic
> dishonesty and who wants or is required to repeat that course may re-take
> that course only as a regularly scheduled course that is open to the student
> community in general. In exceptional circumstances, this condition may be
> revoked, but only by an explicit action to that effect by the full Computer
> Science Committee, and only then on a case by case basis.
> 5. The term academic dishonesty is used throughout in the sense provided by
> the rules and regulations of West Chester University. The following is taken
> from The Ram's Eye View of 1997-1998: **“Academic dishonesty as it applies to
> students includes but is not limited to academic cheating; plagiarism; the
> sale, purchase, or exchange of term papers or research papers; falsification
> of information which includes any form of providing false or misleading
> information, written, electronic, or oral; or of altering or falsifying
> official institutional records. Plagiarism is defined as copying another's
> work or portion thereof and/or using ideas and concepts of another and
> presenting them as one's own without giving proper credit to the source.”**
>
> ### No-Grade, Violation of Academic Integrity, and Violation of Student Code of Conduct Policy:
> For questions regarding Academic Dishonesty, the No-Grade policy, Sexual
> Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer
> to their major department’s handbook, the Undergraduate Course Catalogue, the
> Rams Eye View, or the University Web Site. Please understand that improper
> conduct in any of these areas will not be tolerated and may result in
> immediate ejections from the class.
>
> ### ADA Policy:
> If you have a disability that requires accommodations under the Americans
> with Disabilities Act (ADA), please present your letter of accommodations
> and meet with me as soon as possible so that I can support your success in
> an informed manner. Accommodations cannot be granted retroactively. If you
> would like to know more about West Chester University’s Services for Students
