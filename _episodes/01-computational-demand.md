> ## How do we measure speed in computation?
> - Floating-Point Operation per Second (FLOPS)
>   - Count number of floating-point calculations (arithmetic operations) per second.
> - Not MIPS (millions of instructions per second) as MIPS also count non-arithmetic
> operations such as data movement or condition.
> $$
>   FLOPS = sockets \times \frac{cores}{socket} \times \frac{cycles}{second} \times \frac{FLOPS}{cycle}
> $$
> - MFLOPS (megaFLOPS) = 1,000,000 FLOPS
> - GGLOPS (gigaFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000 FLOPS

> ## Modern measurement of speed
> - TFLOPS (teraFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
>   - Intel's ASCI Red for Sandia National Laboratory (DOE) was the first supercomputer in the world 
>   to achieve 1 TFLOPS in 1997. 
>   - ASCI Red is used for large-scale simulation in nuclear weapon development and material analysis. 
> - PFLOPS (petaFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
>   - IBM RoadRunner for Los Alamos National Laboratory (DOE) was the first supercomputer to achieve 
>   1 PFLOPS in 2008. 
>   - Oak Ridge National Laboratoryâ€™s Summit (DOE) is the second fastest supercomputer in the world at 
>   148.6 PFLOPS.
>   - Fugaku of RIKEN Center for Computational Science (Japan) is the current fastest supercomputer at 
>   415 PFLOPS. 
> - EFLOPS (exaFLOPS)  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
>   - Aurora (> 1 EFLOPS, 2021, Argonne National Lab)
>   - Frontier (> 1.5 EFLOPS, 2021, Oak Ridge National Lab)
>   - El Capitan (> 2 FFLOPS, 2023, Lawrence Livermore National Lab)
>   - Tianhe 3 (first China Exascale computer, 2020, National University of Defense Technology)
>   - Subsequent update to Fugaku (first Japan Exascale computer, 2021, RIKEN Center for Computational Science)
>   - Europe, India, Taiwan on track

> ## The bragging list (The TOP500 Project)
> - List the 500 most powerful computers in the world.
> - Count FLOPS by having supercomputer runs well-known computationally intensive tasks
>   - Solve Ax=b, dense random matrix problem. 
>   - Primarily dense matrix-matrix multiplications. 
> - Updated twice a year:
>   - International Supercomputing conference (June, Germany)
>   - Supercomputing conference (November, US).

> ## Why do we need this much speed?
> - The four modern paradigms of science
>   - Theory
>   - Experiment
>   - Simulation
>   - Data analysis
> - Simulation: study things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous. 
> - Data anlaysis: study data that are too big, too complex, too fast (streaming data), too noisy.

> ## Hurricane Sandy (2012)
>  - the deadliest and most destructive, as well as the strongest hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, 
>  - the second-costliest hurricane on record in the United States (nearly $70 billion in damage in 2012),
>  - affected 24 states, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York,
>  - hit New York City on October 29, flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and cutting power in and around the city.
