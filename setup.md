## Installation of VSCode

- Go to [VSCode's download page][vscode] and download the correct package for your computer (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux). 
- For Windows, you can download `User Installer 64-bit` version if you only want to install VSCode into your user account.  


## Link VSCode to taz.cs.wcupa.edu

- Launch VSCode. 
- On the left bar, select the `Extension` button (the button with blocks).

## Setup GitHub account
- If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub web page][github] to sign up for an account. 
- It should be noted that you can link multiple email addresses to a GitHub account. Even if you
 already have a GitHub account, you might want to link the account to your WCUPA email. 


## Setup an XSEDE account
- Visit [XSEDE Portal page][xsede] to create an account on XSEDE. 
- Watch out in case the confirmation email will go into WCUPA' spam folder. You can visit [https://wcupa.login-us.mimecast.com/], click on the `...` side tab, then `Personal On Hold` to see if the 
confirmation email is there. 
- Once you finished registering, go to the following [Google Form](http://bit.ly/2ZtIas1) to fill out information about your XSEDE account. It is **important** that you give me your XSEDE account, which is the `USER NAME` that you use to login to XSEDE portal.
